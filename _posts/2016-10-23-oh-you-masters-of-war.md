Veja magazine displays its ignorance once again when it writes that the Nobelization of Dylan is a triumph of pop over fine literature.

Dylan has never been pop. Not like Lady Gaga or Rod Stewart. I know. I recently checked and re-checked

I used one of those infamous `.torrent` files the kids use today to vacuum down every freaking Dylan record between 1963 and 2012 in `FLAC` format. 

Lossless. 	

And so [the Brazilian Facebooks are all a-Twitter](http://www.brasil247.com/pt/247/cultura/261752/Academia-critica-desprezo-de-Bob-Dylan-por-Nobel-%E2%80%98descort%C3%AAs-e-arrogante%E2%80%99.htm): the Nobel lit committee is calling Bob Dylan «arrogant» in his attitude to the announcement that he is to be en-Nobelized if he so chooses. 

[O Fuxico notes](http://www.ofuxico.com.br/noticias-sobre-famosos/bob-dylan-retira-mencao-ao-premio-nobel-de-literatura-de-seu-site-oficial/2016/10/22-277874.html) -- a good old Portuguese word for «gossip, intrigue, plot» -- that Dylan or his Webmaster has removed references to the Nobel from [the official Web site](http://bobdylan.com/).

### I Just Want You To Know I Can See Through Your Masks

Is this really so hard to understand?

[Alfred Nobel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Nobel) was a conscience-stricken Swedish high-explosives tycoon.

Bob Dylan is the singer-songwriter of "Masters of War" -- a song later covered by Pearl Jam, I do believe. Not probably but most absolute certainly the greatest protest song ever composed.

The «you» in this song most certainly includes Herr Nobel, of whom Dylan writes,

<pre>And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand over your grave
'Til I'm sure that you're dead.</pre>

Bob Dylan, 1988, Greek Theatre, UC Berkeley. A version of "All Along the Watchtower" that could easily have been pouring out from the Sex Pistols. Peak memories.

### And As For You, Bretônio?

And myself? 

The Internet came back on, finally. And the lights in the Vila Madalena. We were this close to a lightning strike that evening, one that literally almost blew our socks off: Neuza was taking down washing from the clothesline in the back yard and was frightened senseless. 

It was Nobelistic in its explosive force, as were the usual series of electrical transformer explosions in the neighborhood. 

And of course the *meninas* -- Domingas, Rita Lee and Elis Regina, our *cadelinhas* -- were utterly freaked out. Such a fit of howling as you have never heard.

But for the moment, all quiet and 24 degrees C on the Sambodian front.

At the moment, stooped over the infernal machine, I am serving up a Jigsaw `Hello World` page on `http://localhost:3000` and a Harp server page on `http://localhost:6666`. 

Grunt is watching for changes and updating accordingly. I watch it nervously for the dreaded `node-sass` error.

This while running various other processes in the background. We all possess such powerful computing machines but do wo little with them. Like the human brain, they say.

I spent an earlier hour creating `Adeus Mundo Imundo` pages for various of the projects to be reviewed in the [Admiráveis Engenhos](http://admiraveis-engenhos.surge.sh/) project. I am starting to write it. Troubleshooting Middleman is my first note.

I am now doing a `git push` of my screenshots for the project. This is `adeus mundo imundo` from Phenomic -- which reminds me of Phnom Penh and of the Khmer Rouge.

If I can just stop giving in to my attention deficit order for a moment, however, [I have this tutorial queued up](https://www.andreagrandi.it/2013/02/24/using-twitter-bootstrap-with-node-js-express-and-jade/). 

I am learning the Jade templating engine first for sake of the simple Vanilla, Bootstrap and Groundwork projects I am building in the garage like a Soapbox Derby car.

Jade looks like this.

I would like to be able to create [something as excellent as this](http://rriemann.github.io/middleman-blog-template-duocolor) by the end of next year.

<pre>Come you masters of war
You that build all the guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks.

You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly.

Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain.

You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion'
As young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud.

You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins.

How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
That even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do.

Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul.

And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand over your grave
'Til I'm sure that you're dead.
</pre>
