>The highest love, a woman's touch /
Harmony, a strong mind, a strong body /
Beauty all the things he couldn't be, /
All the things he couldn't have. /
Little man with a gun in his hand

[The Minutemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minutemen_(band)). 

All their songs were one minute long. 

Songwriter and guitarist [D. Boon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Boon) died in a van accident 30 years ago. And I still have my collection of [Minutemen albums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Boon) on CD.
