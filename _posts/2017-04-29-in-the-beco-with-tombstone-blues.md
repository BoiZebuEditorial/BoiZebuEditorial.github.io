**Lápide** is Sambodian for tombstone. 

Tombstone is investment bankerese for those little trophies ginned up and distributed to the team to celebrate executed deals.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/80716472799db98769003ffa76befe2f8ad5d3d5/images/100px.lightnavresponse.png" style="width:400px;">

 I like to use the term for Hello World pages.
 
 I am busy these days making **lápide** and landing pages &mdash; above &mdash; as well as kitchen-sink pages for some of the more commonly used CSS frameworks. And some not so well known. I collect them like baseball cards.
 
 I have a good collection of Semantic UI tombstones that I have been turning into kitchen sinks, for example.

<img src="https://github.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/blob/80716472799db98769003ffa76befe2f8ad5d3d5/images/500pxlatebreakfastsemantic.png?raw=true" style="width:450px;">

A Semantic UI page with responsive side navigation running on Brunch.

I organize my work making lists of homework, using those icon headers I like so much, and then filling in the blanks. Cards, panels, segments, messages.

<img src="https://github.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/blob/80716472799db98769003ffa76befe2f8ad5d3d5/images/500pxsemanticsuccessleftmenutoggle.png?raw=true" style="width:450px;">

But as to [brunch](http://brunch.io/).

### Morning in Sambodia

This morning I make the coffee and feed the menina-dogs and update Arch Linux with `sudo pacman -Syu` and avoid the news, even though we are witnessing  what might be a historic general strike here in Sambodia. 

Or an underwhelming one. That is the question

The social security reform law passed by a government of dubious legitimacy is union- and by extension Lula-busting to the nth dgree.


**Fora Temer**!

But I am more interested in building tombstone pages. For my portfolio. In theory. What can  one gringo do? Not even a vote.

> I am in the alley with the tombstone blues ....

### A Technical Kvetch

And oh, how I dislike Jekyll and Ruby in general.

As I try to narrow down a bug in [my English-language GitLab Web log](http://echolalia.surge.sh/) I turn to this here neglected Jeyll-powered writing space for writing about life in general outside my obsessive-compulsive hacking of systems for transforming [words into type](https://www.abebooks.com/book-search/title/words-into-type/).

This here is [the last post that got pushed successfully](http://bretonio.gitlab.io/echolalia/post/near-breath-experience/). It is more than a little feverish, befitting the state of my Sambodian health at the time. 

But turning to Jekyll, the platform for this writing space.

<img src="https://github.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/blob/80716472799db98769003ffa76befe2f8ad5d3d5/images/250px.sambodiablues.png?raw=true" style="width:450px;">

How did I know that after the failure of `bundle exec jekyll serve` to address the verbosity of errors from just plain `jekyll serve` I would have to perform yet another `bundle install` that likewise would fail repeatedly until after I messed around with `Gemfile.lock` and `rbenv rehash` and what not in order to fix a foobarred dependency? 

I just knew. All too familiar. And now it is throwing a build error. Ah, I see. Incorrectly formatted front matter. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/master/images/500pxjekyllpitaerrormsg.png" style="width: 450px;">

But as to the creation of more sophisticated Hello World pages, or tombstones, I have made a lot of progress since that last post, I think. 

<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/d0d15049404e0f94873d4a6f34ba7f408c1cb2cf/images/400px.foundationfeioide.png' style='width: 425px;'>

Above, Foundation 6 boilerplate au Bretônio.  

Your mission, should you choose to accept it: Create a responsive grid that collapses at the appropriate point while doing a <kbd>Shift-Ctl-I</kbd> on Chrome and some <kbd>Alt-F8</kbd> adjustments from Arch.

Here is [Beauter CSS](http://beauter.outboxcraft.com/docs/containers) emulating a smartphone app.


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/80716472799db98769003ffa76befe2f8ad5d3d5/images/100px.gbeauternumtelephonequalquer.png" style="width:450p;x">

A  screen-capture sampling of my other work over the Sambodian summer &mdash; you probably call it winter &mdash; is [here](https://github.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/commit/d0d15049404e0f94873d4a6f34ba7f408c1cb2cf#diff-59b514174bffe4ae402b3d63aad79fe0).

I really need to crank out some actual work samples, however.

### Hard Landings

So lately I have been working  on landing pages and hero units and responsive navigation, after [that case of rocking pneumonia I survived](http://bretonio.gitlab.io/echolalia/post/near-breath-experience/).

Learning to code those up from scratch, and uploading screen grabs to  [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/commit/80716472799db98769003ffa76befe2f8ad5d3d5#diff-59b514174bffe4ae402b3d63aad79fe0) in order to keep track of what I have been up to. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/24beb864fa708d9681a81fcbf1d069f777dcff39/images/200px.blazetelapequenaaterrissagem.png" style="width:350;">

Above, a small-screen rendering of a theme for [Blaze CSS](http://blazecss.com/), one of many frameworks I have built boilerplate for lately. 

Below, a predesigned hero page for [Bulma](http://bulma.io/) with easy adaptations &mdash; by far the most pleasing discovery of recent months.

<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/d0d15049404e0f94873d4a6f34ba7f408c1cb2cf/images/400px.bulmamostlybom.png' style='width: 450px'>

I have not tried it yet with a background image. but it should work. I need a new wallpaper image. Change this up a bit. All of my card and panel elements reature either Bob Dylan or Donald Trump for example.

I like Duchamp-like engravings of 19th Century printing presses as well.

### Roots Rock Reggae

But I work with a number of frameworks. A large number. Maybe too large for comfortable sanity although I feel just fine more or less.

Here are the contents of my [Roots](http://roots.cx/) folder, for example.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/3d5bb8f9e74ec520a4bed28ecce727c22ee4816f/images/250px.myrootsrockreggaefolder.png" style="width:450px;">

Roots is a great little static site generator. I just cannot seem to get a handle on its native stylesheet, called [Axis](http://axis.netlify.com/). I just cannot grok the docs.

I also use [Harp](https://harpjs.com/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for day to day culture hacking and jacking. And quite a few others to a lesser degree. I like [Yeogurt](https://github.com/larsonjj/generator-yeogurt) for example. 

Never had much luck with Middleman or AweStruct, on the other hand. In general I prefer Pug to coding up all that HTML and trying to keep track of the tags that need closing and when. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/d0d15049404e0f94873d4a6f34ba7f408c1cb2cf/images/400px.bootstrappugnonsense.png" style="width:450px;">

You can find other examples of recent tombstones on [my Portuguese-Paraguaio notebook](http://bretonio.gitlab.io/gringolalia/2017/04/19/decolagens-aterrissagens) which for some strange reason **did** succeed at executing the `git push -u origin master` command. 

Probably just a tab character out of place in some buried file. 

### I Dream of Geany

Geany has been my code editor of choice lately because Gedit constantly throws this deeply annoying GTK+ error. 

But this post is  written in Ghostwriter.  

Itself not a wholly satisfactory solution. 	

What is it with modern designers and their fondness for the rendering of text and the freaking cursor in quasi-invisible light gray? 

And how do you freaking activate the Markdown preview on 
Geany? And how to stop it from pasting upon left clicks?  That really annoys.

I gave Atom another try &mdash; I appreciate the way it detaches from the terminal session so that I can get that browser sync effect more easily &mdash; but as many others have complained at a certain point it just stops responding when called upon. Reinstall and nothing doing. 

### Tombstone Blueprints

Now consider the following.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/80716472799db98769003ffa76befe2f8ad5d3d5/images/100px.beauterfuncionandorespons.png" style="width:400px;">

It does not look like much, but it represents a successfully cooked homemade responsive topbar navigation.

This for example is [Caramel](http://kurisubrooks.com/caramel/) for your widescreen smart TV or Bloomberg box.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/d0d15049404e0f94873d4a6f34ba7f408c1cb2cf/images/400px.caramelrootshomemaderesposive.png" style="width:375px;">

And this is Caramel CSS for your relatively miniscule reputedly intelligent telephone. On the left with the Chrome console on the right.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/d0d15049404e0f94873d4a6f34ba7f408c1cb2cf/images/400px.caramelprovenresponsive.png" style="width: 375px;">

The well-received [Concise CSS](http://concisecss.com/) on the other hand is a work in progress for me.

I still do not yet understand its grid system. Set the following to render columns to twelve wide when viewing on a small, portrait-oriented screen. Not like this.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/4bdb018f7a7d39eaa5a249fddbb52453dd490883/100px.concisecssfoobarsofar.png" style="width:400px;">

But more like the following!

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/4bdb018f7a7d39eaa5a249fddbb52453dd490883/100px.concisetelegraficoworkingcollapse.png" style="width:450px;">

By assigning the correct grid value to the relevant viewport size or breakpoint as they say.


### Superheroics 


But  I believe I mentioned heroics and landing pages and the like &mdash; mostly serving as points of entry at the root of your primary URL. I have multiplied examples and gotten pretty good at them lately. Home cooked like the pure blue crank of Walter White..

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/d0d15049404e0f94873d4a6f34ba7f408c1cb2cf/images/400px.basisparaseucelularadeus.png" style="width:450px;">

That is [Basis](https://getbasis.github.io/) &mdash;  modest but a decent source of configurable pre-coded navigation.

Above, an early Pug-ugly Basis-based splash page with Greek Lorem Ipsum.

And here is [Bijou](http://andhart.github.io/bijou/), a little-known but groovy SASS framework.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/bff37579cb0fd7d1a98176ff79dc0592fa81f182/images/250px.bijounotbad.png" style="width: 450px">

And a more simple example, one of my first efforts, but  still full-page and vertical justified under the hood.

<img src="https://github.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/blob/80716472799db98769003ffa76befe2f8ad5d3d5/images/400px.kiernelcsspanicwithheroism.png?raw=true" style="width:400px;"> 

The name of the game is to author working equivalents to the splash page for [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).

<img src="https://github.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/blob/80716472799db98769003ffa76befe2f8ad5d3d5/images/500pxBigCoverjadeinharpyescompile.png?raw=true" style="width:400px;">

Another excellent model to copy: Bootup.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/master/images/gringolaliabootup.png" style="width:400px;">

And so to that end, [Cirrus](https://spiderpig86.github.io/Cirrus/), below, is also worth the effort of reading the comments in the source code &mdash; a good skill to learn, along with <kbd>Ctl-U</kbd> in Google Chrome and translating the source code to Pug.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/4bdb018f7a7d39eaa5a249fddbb52453dd490883/100px.cirrusaterrissagemepouso.png" style="width: 450px;">


### Babble, Babble On

Examples of my tombstone period, as future art historians will call it, can be multiplied.

I have a whole series based on the Tower of Babel of Breugel the Elder &mdash; which also serves as my Arch Linux desktop wallpaper.

[Beauter](http://beauter.outboxcraft.com/) responsive horizontal navigation works out of the box for example.

<img="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/80716472799db98769003ffa76befe2f8ad5d3d5/images/100px.gbeauternumtelephonequalquer.png" style="width:450px;">

And then in the do it yourself department, I was able to build a working responsive top nav for the very modest [Potato CSS](http://potatocss.com/).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/80716472799db98769003ffa76befe2f8ad5d3d5/images/100px.potatograndeexitoresponsa.png" style="width:350px">

It may  not look like much but it represents a moment of minor technical enlightenment.


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/80716472799db98769003ffa76befe2f8ad5d3d5/images/100px.batatabotao.png" style="width:350px">  


Building a landing page &mdash; página de pouso &mdash; for [Light CSS](https://cquanu.github.io/light/#components) was interesting. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/4bdb018f7a7d39eaa5a249fddbb52453dd490883/100px.lightbombrincacomopaciidade.png" style="width:450px;">


Light has its own custom animated navigation that works like a modal &mdash; a component I am studying with the help of [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_responsive.asp).

Click the ellipses and the menu bar items file out like a jury.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/4bdb018f7a7d39eaa5a249fddbb52453dd490883/100px.3000lightnavresponse.png" style="width:325px;">

And here is a tombstone with the modest [Furtive CSS](http://furtive.co/).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/4bdb018f7a7d39eaa5a249fddbb52453dd490883/100px.makeffurtiveresponsive.png" style="width:450px;">
 
That tombstone is waiting for its responsive navigation. Thank you 
for reminding me.

And a landing page with Blaze CSS except that it still needs the button or nav that takes you to an inside page.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/d0d15049404e0f94873d4a6f34ba7f408c1cb2cf/images/400px.adeusmundrusso.png" style="width:350px;">

Here is a second run at a Blaze tombstone, this time with navigation and a set-up in Harp rather than Roots.

A `harp init harp-with-blaze` project with Less is simpler for the purposes of creating my own partials and other aspects of layout. Other templating languages are still beyond  my technical expertise.

So: Make a folder called `partials`  and do `touch partials/__header.jade` and `touch/partials/__footer.jade` and  add the extends statements and Bob is your uncle.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/24beb864fa708d9681a81fcbf1d069f777dcff39/images/200px.blazetelagrande.png" style="width:450px;">

And a tablet and smartphone version of the Blaze-based boilerplate 

<img src="https://github.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/blob/80716472799db98769003ffa76befe2f8ad5d3d5/images/200px.blazetelapequenaaterrissagem.png?raw=true" style="width:350px;">

And so many other tombstones to be engraved.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/80716472799db98769003ffa76befe2f8ad5d3d5/images/100px.mobicollapsedcorrectly.png"style="width:400px;">

I could spend a solid month coding up kitchen sink pages with W3.css alone. 

<img="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/80716472799db98769003ffa76befe2f8ad5d3d5/images/100px.w3csskitchencinq.png" style="width:450px">

 Maybe that is what I should do.


### The Love Song of Jeremy Hillary Boob

So little time so much to code up in Pug &mdash; or consult [HTML2Jade](http://html2jade.org/) about.

For example, what am I working on now? 

I try to get in a couple of hours with Semantic UI or Foundation or some variant of Material Design or other more widely used frameworks a day. 

<img src="https://github.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/blob/80716472799db98769003ffa76befe2f8ad5d3d5/images/500px.romulussimplestackable.png?raw=true" style="width:350px;">

But then I give myself leeway to digress. 

My excuse is that I am studying some aspect of design that holds true across platforms. I should not just learn Bootstrap and Semantic. I should be able to code up their functions from scratch more or less.

An excellent resource for that purpose is [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_navigation.asp).

<img="" style="width:400px;">

I have several kitchen-sink pages going with this stylesheet at the moment.

<img src="https://github.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/blob/80716472799db98769003ffa76befe2f8ad5d3d5/images/w3cssgradecardapio.png?raw=true" style="width:400px;">

But what I really enjoy is approaching a new stylesheet and seeing what I can make of it. 

[Vital CSS](https://vitalcss.com/), for example, received home-cooked responsive top navigation and a sort of an Art Deco typeface.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/4bdb018f7a7d39eaa5a249fddbb52453dd490883/100px.vitalgritante.png" style="width:450px;">

And a collapsed version with Font Awesome java jive and my logo. 

Engenho Novo, by the way &mdash; my fictitious offshore investment trust &mdash; refers to a giddy Bahian song made popular by Gilberto Gil after an earlier recording by Bidu Sayão. 

An inland town is abuzz with delight when the new sugarcane mill arrives.

> Bote a roda pra rodar

«Get that wheel a-wheeling!»

<img src="https://github.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/blob/80716472799db98769003ffa76befe2f8ad5d3d5/images/300px.vitalnobility.png?raw=true" style="width: 325px;"> 


I need to add navigation as well for the [Uptown](http://www.uptowncss.com/) girl living in an uptown world.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/4bdb018f7a7d39eaa5a249fddbb52453dd490883/100px.uptownbomba.png" style="width:325px;">

Uptown has a "zero state" element similar to the "tabula rasa" in Picnic CSS.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/4bdb018f7a7d39eaa5a249fddbb52453dd490883/100px.uptownzerostatemordanthumor.png" style="width:325px;">

### Spudnik Unbound

Now, [Potato CSS](http://potatocss.com/) may not look like much but it was the first framework I got to serve up the items of the collapsed menu when clicking the hamburger. 

The first homemade effort, I mean.

Other recent discoveries include the fabulous [Beauter](http://beauter.outboxcraft.com/docs/containers) and the beautiful out of the box [Furatto](http://icalialabs.github.io/furatto/examples/).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/24beb864fa708d9681a81fcbf1d069f777dcff39/images/200px.furattoisprettygood.png" style="width:325px;">

The Cathar Cross and the biohazard symbol are personal signatures of mine. Accept only the authentic @bretonio.


Beauter is out of the box responsive. I like that.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/4bdb018f7a7d39eaa5a249fddbb52453dd490883/100px.beauterfuncionandorespons.png" style="width:325px;">

And it presents you with collapsed vertical navigation in place of the horizontal on your intelligent telephony device.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/4bdb018f7a7d39eaa5a249fddbb52453dd490883/100px.gbeauternumtelephonequalquer.png" style="width: 450px;">

[Cirrus](https://spiderpig86.github.io/Cirrus/) is a very promising framework as well. 

I just need to figure out how to hide selected navigation elements according to the breakpoints. Items in the icon menu, for example.

I know how to do this in Semantic, so how different can it be?

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/4bdb018f7a7d39eaa5a249fddbb52453dd490883/100px.cirrusaterrissagemepouso.png" style="width:350px;">

### Point Break: Surfing the Grid

And let us close with [Pavilion](http://www.pavilion.io/), which I found challenging at first.

Here, I set a column configuration in the grid to yield unequal columns at a certain breakpoint, on purpose, just to get my head around how that works, exactly. 

The result:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/4bdb018f7a7d39eaa5a249fddbb52453dd490883/100px.pavilionresponsivocomeco.png"" style="width:450px;">

It resolves to an asymmetric arrangement of the columns as I asked on the large screen.On smaller screens, it evens out or it stacks, as required. The top navigation discreetly disappears but I would like to choose which icons can appear or hidden. This is doable.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/4bdb018f7a7d39eaa5a249fddbb52453dd490883/100px.pavilionprecisasenavrespons.png" style="width:350px;">

On your desktop or laptop or landscape tablet &mdash; who really uses tablet computers anyway? &mdash; with an icon menu and a stylish font  &mdash; Ubuntu Condensed, I think &mdash; it looks so very nice. 

Now to hide and show navbar items as desired or give it a collapsing menu. 

I have also yet to reverse engineer the topbar navigation.

### You May Grid When Ready

And more. 

[Mini](https://chalarangelo.github.io/mini.css/navigation.html) is helping me with the whole responsive grid configuration question, for example. 

It is crazy well documented, 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/80716472799db98769003ffa76befe2f8ad5d3d5/images/100px.minitotheemax.png" style="width:400px;">

I use Yeogurt a fair amount as well to create my Sass boilerplate. If I ever actually master Sass.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/d0d15049404e0f94873d4a6f34ba7f408c1cb2cf/images/400px.bootstrappugnonsense.png" style="width:450px;">

It is easy to drop stylesheets into a Yeogurt-generated scaffold, which has Pug-Jade baked in, like all the generators I use. I hate writing HTML.

Here we try out a mobile-first version of Milligram with home-cooked navigation.

<img src="https://github.com/bretonio/bretonio.github.io/blob/80716472799db98769003ffa76befe2f8ad5d3d5/images/400px.yeogurtmillinavcaseira.png?raw=true" style="width:400px;">



But nothing beats [Bulma](http://bulma.io/).
